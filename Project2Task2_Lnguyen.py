#Project 2 Task 2
'''Objective: Use Python Generator feature to produce a sequence of prime numbers â€“ the generator is able to keep 
generating prime numbers, i.e. no limit. Then, write a main function to do the following: 
(1) generate 50 prime numbers and print out the results (i.e. print out the first 50 prime numbers) 
(2) After the first 50 prime number generated, skip 50 prime numbers, then continue to generate additional 1000 
prime numbers  (i.e. 101st to 1100th). No need to print out all prime numbers, but do print out:  the first one (i.e. 
101st  prime number), the last one (i.e. 1100th prime number), and how much time (in seconds) it takes to perform 
step (2). 
Note: using a normal function to generate prime numbers is NOT acceptable. Must define a generator. '''
